# Netview Web Browser 1.0
Welcome to the future - year 1985. Ask yourself, what if we lived in a time close to the year 1985? And in this reality web technology advanced further than the designs of the most advance UIs of the time?


## What is Netview Web Browser?
Netview is a concept web browser inspired from the questions above. I imagined there could be an intersesting marriage between 80s design and modern web techology. So, I started researching the history and evolution of UI designs and I decided to create an application that looked like MS-DOS Windows version 1.0ish. I wanted to make my 'web browser' to look like a system from the 80s yet capable of handling fancy things - like responsive design.

## Getting Started:
#### Clone Repo with this command
1. `git clone --single-branch --branch ibm-master https://github.com/jannaee/Netview-express.git`
2. Using your terminal cd into `netview-express`
3. Run `npm start`, the app is now listening on port 3000 (Make sure you are not running anything on port 3000)
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`in your browser, and experience the future.

***Special Note: Sneak peek into this application with no content visit: [I'm an inline-style link](https://netview.netlify.com). This is a dev environment without the server working so this will only show you what the site looks like with no data loaded.  

## Files
I have included a directory called wireframes to show some of the design and process behind developing this web application.

## My To Dos
I think of web development much like painting or sculpting. Your work is never really finished. There are a few items that I was not able to complete or add to this project. I will continue to develop this application because it was just way too fun!

[_] Data for Episodes has been fetched, however I still need to render it onto the final table.
[ ] Incorporate service workers for offline use
[ ] Clean up the design for the drop down menus
[ ] Restructure work for optimal semantics
[ ] Rebuild in with Aframe - 3D framework
[ ] Sync up to Netlify


## Closing remarks
Thank you for allowing me the chance to work on this project and also for having such a fun theme to work with. I may have put in a few more than 6 hours, but it was an absolute pleasure. Please feel free to reach out to me at jannaee@gmail.com or 904.994.5220.
