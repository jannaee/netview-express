# Netview w/Express
Welcome to the future - year 1985


## Intro and explaination of my project files
The inspiration for this project is based on an the question... "What if there had been an alternate reality set in the year 1985. What would a browser look like if it had been designed in the 80s yet leveraged modern web techology?" I began researching the evolution of Computer UI design and I decided to create an application that looked like MS-DOS Windows version 1-2 but could do fancy 'new' things like have responsive design.


## Files:
- Please navigate to branch `release-v1`for the most up to date project files.
- Netview.zip (static html/css/s files)
- NetviewService.zip (files for an express server)
- wireframes.zip (a few screenshots of the wireframing planning stages for the design)



## Getting Started:
Apologies for the crude way this is set up, it was my first time setting up an express service from scratch.

1. Unzip both the NetViewService.zip and Netview.zip and run `npm install` for both
  (They will should sit as siblings to one another in a directory)
2. Navigate to your NetViewService directory
3. Run `npm start` the app is now listening on port 3000
4. See Netview the web browser of 1985 - `http://localhost:3000/`



##TO DO:

I think of web development much like painting or sculpting. Your work is never really finished. There are a few items that I was not able to complete or add to this project. I will continue to develop this application because it was just way too fun!

- Data for Episodes has been fetched, however I still need to render it onto the final table.
- Incorporate service workers for offline use
- Clean up the design for the drop down menus
- Restructure work for optimal semantics
- Rebuild in with Aframe - 3D framework


##Closing
Thank you for allowing me the chance to work on this project and also for having such a fun theme to work with. I may have put in a few more than 6 hours, but it was an absolute pleasure. Please feel free to reach out to me at jannaee@gmail.com or 904.994.5220.
