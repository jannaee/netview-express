# Netview Web Browser 1.0
Welcome to the future - year 1985


## What is Netview Web Browser?
Netview is a fictional web browser like design. The inspiration for this project is based on a few questions... "What if there had been an alternate reality set in the year 1985. What would a browser look like if it had been designed in the 80s yet leveraged modern web techology?" I began researching the history and evolution of computer UI designs and I decided to create an application that looked like MS-DOS Windows version 1.0 - 2.0. I wanted to make my `web browser` to look like a system from the 80s yet capable of handling fancy things like responsive design.

## Getting Started:
#### Clone Repo with this command
1. `git clone --single-branch --branch ibm-master https://github.com/jannaee/Netview-express.git`
2. cd into `netview-express`
3. Run `npm start`, the app is now listening on port 3000
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser


## MY PERSONAL TO DO:

I think of web development much like painting or sculpting. Your work is never really finished. There are a few items that I was not able to complete or add to this project. I will continue to develop this application because it was just way too fun!

[ ] Data for Episodes has been fetched, however I still need to render it onto the final table.
[ ] Incorporate service workers for offline use
[ ] Clean up the design for the drop down menus
[ ] Restructure work for optimal semantics
[ ] Rebuild in with Aframe - 3D framework
[ ] Sync up to Netlify


##Closing
Thank you for allowing me the chance to work on this project and also for having such a fun theme to work with. I may have put in a few more than 6 hours, but it was an absolute pleasure. Please feel free to reach out to me at jannaee@gmail.com or 904.994.5220.
